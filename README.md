# Lab 04 - SOP/POS and KMaps

In this lab, you’ve learned how to apply KMaps, Sum Of Products and Products of
sums to simplify digital logic equations. Then, you’ve proven out that they work
using an implemented design on your Basys3 boards.

## Lab Questions

### Why are the groups of 1’s (or 0’s) that we select in the KMap able to go across edges?
They are grouped in a way that both the groups of 1's or 0's visibly next to each other as well as across edges have an element in common

### Why are the names Sum of Products and Products of Sums?
That is the literal boolean logic description of the types of and/or gates used to implement the equation

### Open the test.v file – how are we able to check that the signals match using XOR?
